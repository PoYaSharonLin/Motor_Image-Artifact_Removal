# Motor_Image-Artifact_Removal

## Branch 1. Motor imagery-based BCI 

**Instructions:**
1. Choose one of the following toolboxes based on your preference and programming
expertise:
- a. MartMi-BCI (MATLAB): An advanced MATLAB toolbox for motor imagery
BCI research. Access MartMi-BCI on GitHub.
- b. MNE (Python): A comprehensive Python library for processing EEG data with
tools for motor imagery analysis. Explore MNE motor imagery example.
2. Follow the tutorials or documentation associated with the toolbox to load and
preprocess their sample motor imagery EEG dataset.
3. Apply techniques such as Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) to extract features relevant
for distinguishing between different motor imagery tasks.
4. Topographic Mapping: Generate and present topographic maps of the spatial filters
(CSP patterns) for different motor imagery tasks to visualize how brain activity differs
across tasks.
